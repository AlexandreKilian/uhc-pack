## Features

* *Team selection* - Allow players to select their own teams as well as allow for them to be randomized between a specified number of teams.
  Players can also choose to spectate only. Players who join after the game has started automatically spectate.
* *World configuration* - Pick from a number of world sizes, from 500-3K blocks wide. Chunks can also be pre-generated to avoid lag during gameplay.
  To encourage combat, you can also configure a shrinking border with control over when it starts shrinking, the duration it shrinks for and the
  eventual border size.
* *Minute markers* - To help keep track of time, minute markers can be configured.
* *Late game options* - Encourage teams to engage in PVP by triggering external day and glowing effects.
* *Buffs and Nerfs* - Control the balance of your UHC using toggles for whether strong potions or suspicious stews are allowed.
