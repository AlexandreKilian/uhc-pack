There may be game breaking bugs in either.

## How to setup

2. Place the zip file in in the `<world>/datapacks/` folder
3. Run `/reload` on your server to detect the new datapack
4. Decide the center of your map and teleport to it e.g. `/tp @s 0 ~ 0`
5. Run `/function uhc_pack:setup` to prepare the Lobby
